-- The redo logs (or write ahead logs) provide an efficient
-- I/O mechanism to get transaction information to disk
-- (and relative safety).  This information can be used to
-- "redo" transactions in the event of recovery, as well as
-- provide an efficient mechanism for COMMIT processing.

-- So, look at the redo log files for the our instance.
